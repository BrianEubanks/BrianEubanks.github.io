At UCA I performed with the Arkansas Intercollegiate Band, Conway Symphony Orchestra, UCA Wind Ensemble, and UCA Jazz Ensembles. The Wind Ensemble was featured in Carnegie Hall in 2018.

I also enjoy numerous freelance performances, including weddings, church services, and various community events in the Central Arkansas Area.

My students have been successful at All Region in band, orchestra and jazz, and I have worked  brass sectionals from beginner, Junior High, High School, to collegiate.
