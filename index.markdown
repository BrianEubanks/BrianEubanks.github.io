I graduated from The University of Central Arkansas with degrees in Computer Science and Music Performance. 

My CS interests lie in the broad area of Embedded Systems. I enjoy working with bare-metal microcontrollers, bootloaders, kernels, and FPGA architecture design.

This is my personal/professional website which I will dedicate to some of my personal projects, research, and maybe some blogging.
